# Dutchberry Sheriffs Office

## Current State
The website has a fully functional layout with:
- Header navigation with Shield icon (lucide-react)
- Hero section with branding
- About, Services, and Contact sections
- Contact form with backend integration
- Footer with Shield icon

## Requested Changes (Diff)

### Add
- Professional law enforcement logo image for the Dutchberry Sheriffs Office
- Logo display in header (replacing Shield icon)
- Logo display in footer (replacing Shield icon)

### Modify
- Header branding to use custom logo image instead of lucide-react Shield icon
- Footer branding to use custom logo image instead of lucide-react Shield icon

### Remove
- None

## Implementation Plan
1. Generate professional sheriff's office logo with transparent background
2. Update App.tsx to import and display logo in header
3. Update App.tsx to display logo in footer
4. Ensure logo is appropriately sized and styled for both locations

## UX Notes
- Logo should maintain professional law enforcement aesthetic
- Logo should be clearly visible on the primary color background in header
- Logo should integrate seamlessly with existing navigation design
- Logo should replace the existing Shield icon while maintaining layout consistency
